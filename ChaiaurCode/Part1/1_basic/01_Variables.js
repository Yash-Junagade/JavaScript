const id = 1 // constant variable declared with the const keyword (we cannot change the value of the constant variable)

// Variables are declared with the two methods using let and var (mostly we use let because var doesn't follow the scope rules)
let name = "Yash" // variable declared with the let keyword
var age = 21 // variable declared with the var keyword
let add;

city = "Nashik" // we can also create without using any keyword but its a bad practice (don't declare variables in this way)

console.table([id, name, age, add, city]); //console.table is used to print the variables in tabular form
